you need to setup tesserract for pyhton. after then you can use this open source nlp classification code. its made by me and my school friend. it can be use for more title but we use just 3 title. These are : history,math,med. you can change them how you want. the important think is just data set. dont forgot data set. You can use txt file or pdf for classification. it doesnt matter for code. its dynamic for console inputs.
